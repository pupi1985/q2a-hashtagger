=================================================

Description
-----------

Hashtagger is a [Question2Answer][Q2A] plugin that allows user to write user mentions and tags in questions, answers
and comments that will turn into HTML links when saving the post.

Features
--------

 *  Creates links to the user profile when using user mentions like `@pupi1985@` or `@pupi 1985@`
 *  Creates links to the tag pages when using user references like `#cars#`
 *  Internationalization support
 *  No need of core hacks or plugin overrides
 *  Simple installation

Notes:

 *  The plugin works on Q2A version 1.7.x and 1.8.x

Setup comments
--------------

 1. Copy the plugin directory into the `qa-plugin` directory.
 1. In Q2A 1.8+ make sure to enable the plugin from the *Admin -> Plugins* menu option.
 1. Configure the settings based on your needs.

Notes
-------

User mentions can be performed by just writing `@username@` where `username` must be a registered user in the system.
If the mentioned user contains special characters in their handle just input them exactly as their handle.

Tags can be created by just writing `#tag#` where `tag` could be an existent or a non-existent tag in the system.

This plugin fixes some issues generated by the original one when creating tags and adding colors to text at the same
time. It also gives the ability to create links to users with special characters in their user names.

Support
-------

If you've found a bug then create a ticket in the [Issues][issues] section.
