 *  Internationalization support
 *  No need of core hacks or plugin overrides
 *  Simple installation

 *  The plugin works on Q2A version 1.7.x and 1.8.x

Setup comments
--------------

 1. Copy the plugin directory into the `qa-plugin` directory.
 1. In Q2A 1.8+ make sure to enable the plugin from the *Admin -> Plugins* menu option.
 1. Configure the settings based on your needs.

Notes
-------

User mentions can be performed by just writing `@username` where `username` must be a registered user in the system.
These kind of mentions only work for user names that have letters, numbers, undescores `_` and dashes `-` in their
user names.

When trying to mention a user that contains characters not included in the previous list (like spaces), it is
possible to mention them by using `@"user name"`. It is important to open the quotes immediately next to the `@` and to
close them. Otherwise, the mention will not be created.

Tags can be created by just writing `#tag#` where `tag` could be an existent or a non-existent tag in the system.

This plugin fixes some issues generated by the original one when creating tags and adding colors to text at the same
time. It also gives the ability to create links to users with special characters in their user names.

Support
-------

If you've found a bug then create a ticket in the [Issues][issues] section.
